Mastermind game

A small code breaking game, where you can either play as the code maker or the code breaker.

A 4 digit code is generated by the code maker, with values between 0 and 5 inclusive.

The code breaker makes guesses, and then gets a 2 digit response. The first digit represents how many numbers in the guess are correct and in the correct position. The second digit is how many numbers in the guess are correct but in the incorrect position.

Based on the repsonses, the code breaker can make intelligent guesses and break the code.
